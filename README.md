# SFC PAYGo Solar Credit Repayment

## Project Overview

It is estimated that 592 million people in Africa are living without access to electricity. Most of these people live outside of urban centers, and therefore out of reach of the continent’s electricity grid. And as many of us have experienced, the existing systems in many African countries even struggle to supply enough energy to the homes and businesses that are on the grid.

Pay-as-you-go (PAYGo) solar technology has become Africa’s most promising approach to handling the continent’s growing energy problems. PAYGo users pay a small downpayment for a solar kit that provides up to eight hours of emission-free lighting every day, as well as enough energy to charge mobile phones and other devices. With PayGo solar, residents are able to reduce their energy spending by up to 50%.

PAYGo is a pioneering, game-changing credit system that removes the initial financial barrier to solar energy access by allowing consumers to make a series of modest payments to purchase time units (or tokens) for using solar electricity instead of paying upfront for the entire solar lighting system. After the payments are complete, the customer then owns the solar power device, which they can use at no additional cost.

The objective of this challenge is to help predict the next six months of payments for different customers. This will allow PAYGo distributors to provide appropriate services and customer support, ensuring that they can continue to provide these important devices affordably and efficiently to the benefit of people all over Africa.

## Dataset Description

 PAYGo SHS contracts data.

When a customer applies for a loan, banks and other credit providers use statistical models to determine whether or not to grant the loan based on the likelihood of the loan being repaid. The factors involved in determining this likelihood are complex, and extensive statistical analysis and modelling are required to predict the outcome for each individual case. You must implement a similar model that predicts PAYGo SHS contract repayments or defaults based on the data provided.

In this competition, you must explore and cleanse a dataset consisting of over ~37000 PAYGo SHS contracts to determine the best way to predict the repayment profile. You must then build a machine learning model that returns the expected future payments for n months ahead (for this competition n=6).

You could empower your solution by predicting the contract repayment status label (a probability of being paid or not paid) as well. This could indicate whether the contract will be fully paid or defaulted.
